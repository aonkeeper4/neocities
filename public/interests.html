                        <p>OMFG i love this game &lt;3333 i may have only had it for half a year but. god its one of my
                            favorite games of all time (not to mention trans developer and protagonist &lt;3 i love
                            trans ppl soso much we're so cool) i have spent HOLY SHIT OVER 350 HOURS?? um ok ig (tbf idk
                            how much of that is afk time) yeah but like. the gameplay is so fluid the art style is so
                            good the story is,, OK OPINION WARNING but i dont think the story is the highlight of the
                            game. it feels a little underbaked at times but you better believe i was crying after
                            having reached the summit for the first time. i semi-recently came back and 100%ed the game
                            after not really? having played that much in the meantime (cough cough minecraft stole my
                            life again) but MNDSFNMDFNFDKFDSN HOLY SHIT FAREWELL. OMG that shit was like life-changing
                            or something the ending cutscene actually broke me no one talk to me about it or i will cry.
                            anyway im kinda finished with the vanilla game atm but like guys. <a
